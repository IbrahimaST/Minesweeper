<h1 align="center">Minesweeper Game</h1>

<p>For this project, I implemented a version of the classic game Minesweeper, popularized by Microsoft Windows 3.1. It features a grid of cells, each <i>potentially</i> hiding a mine. Players reveal cells by clicking, with outcomes being mine explosions or numbers indicating the location of nearby mines.</p>
